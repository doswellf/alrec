# ALREC  
Lottery Picker - Uses Higher Math (Fourier Analysis,etc) To Pick and Wheel Numbers

This project is starting life as my Jenkins/Docker/Android CI and Testing Project.
As time goes by, the project will consist of both an android tree and a Java desktop tree.

Some initial code will likely be Octave, MatLab, Maxima, and SciLab Code.
There may be other scripts as well, since I now use Sage with all of it's component CAS elements.

For now, this is a small 5 and 10 week frequency counting/compare app that downloads a file 
from a url to update the list of numbers. Later I'll use OLG's xml page and an xml pull parser
to update the app. A working sync adapter and parser are available from another app but time flys...

As the CI project progresses some of the gotchas and  steps will be posted on the wiki for this repository.
